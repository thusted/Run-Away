# Run-Away

## About
This app is a silly game called Run Away, made for Android. Each button you click takes users to a level that tackles an obscure and unusual fear. The screen is populated by people running away from the object of that specific fear. If the user swipes over them, they are consumed by the fear and a counter in the top right corner will keep track of the number of people consumed. The fears addressed in this game are fear of beards, fear of balloons, fear of navel, and fear of the Pope. Enjoy!
