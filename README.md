# Run-Away

## About
This app is a game called Run Away, made for Android. The home screen was designed to create the facade of fear, but due to the fact that I wanted to create something odd and playful, each button you click takes you to a level that tackles an obscure and unusual fear. The screen is populated by people running away from the object of that specific fear. If you swipe over them, they are consumed by the fear and a counter in the top right corner will keep track of the number of people consumed. The fears addressed in this game are fear of beards, fear of balloons, fear of navel, and fear of the Pope. Enjoy!

## Usage
To try this sketch out on your own, make sure you have Processing installed on your machine. Open runAway.pde in Processing and run the sketch. Click any of the four fears to start the game. When all the people have diappeared from screen, the round is over. Press the home icon at any time to return to the home screen. Have fun!
